# CopyAthlete Windows Application Testing Plan

## Overview
This testing plan outlines the steps to verify the functionality and stability of the CopyAthlete Windows application (version 1.1.0) on a clean Windows computer. The plan focuses on ensuring all core features work as expected and identifying any issues that need to be addressed before implementing enhancements.

   - Verify video loads correctly
   - Confirm video appears in the user video section

4. **Video Comparison**
   - Select both coach and user videos
   - Verify "Compare Videos" button becomes active
   - Navigate to comparison screen
   - Test simultaneous playback of both videos
   - Verify skeleton overlay functionality
   - Confirm analysis results are displayed (similarity scores, joint angles, etc.)

### Phase 3: Performance Testing
1. **Resource Usage**
   - Monitor CPU usage during video playback and comparison
   - Check memory consumption during extended use
   - Verify application remains responsive during intensive operations

2. **Stability Testing**
   - Use the application for an extended period (30+ minutes)
   - Perform multiple video comparisons in succession
   - Switch between different coach and user videos repeatedly
   - Verify no memory leaks or performance degradation

### Phase 4: Error Handling
1. **Invalid Input Testing**
   - Attempt to upload unsupported video formats
   - Test with corrupted video files
   - Try comparison with very short videos
   - Verify appropriate error messages are displayed

2. **Recovery Testing**
   - Force close the application during operation
   - Restart and verify it recovers properly
   - Disconnect webcam during recording
   - Verify application handles hardware changes gracefully

### Phase 5: User Experience Testing
1. **UI Consistency**
   - Verify all UI elements are properly aligned and sized
   - Check for any visual glitches or rendering issues
   - Confirm text is readable and properly formatted
   - Test on different screen resolutions if possible

2. **Workflow Efficiency**
   - Evaluate the number of steps required for common tasks
   - Identify any confusing or unintuitive elements
   - Note any potential improvements to user workflow

## Test Documentation

For each test case, document the following:
1. Test name and description
2. Steps performed
3. Expected result
4. Actual result
5. Pass/Fail status
6. Any issues or observations

## Issue Prioritization

Categorize any identified issues as:
- **Critical**: Prevents core functionality from working
