# CopyAthlete DIY Implementation Roadmap

## Overview

This revised implementation roadmap is tailored for a "just you and me" approach to enhancing and expanding the CopyAthlete application. It focuses on what you can accomplish with my guidance, identifies specific areas where freelance help might be needed, and provides a realistic timeline that balances progress with manageable workload and costs.

## Core Principles

1. **Focus on one platform at a time**: Complete and perfect the Windows version before expanding to other platforms
2. **Leverage your strengths**: Prioritize content creation and user testing where you can add the most value
3. **Learn as you build**: Develop technical skills incrementally with guided implementation
4. **Strategic outsourcing**: Identify specific complex tasks for freelance help rather than hiring full-time developers
5. **Revenue-driven expansion**: Use income from earlier versions to fund expansion to additional platforms
